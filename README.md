## Summary

This tutorial will walk you though how to programmatically access ICESat-2 data at the NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC DAAC) using the [`icepyx`](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx) Python library. Access parameters include spatial and temporal filters, as well as customization services including subsetting and reformatting.

## Key Learning Objectives

1. Become familiar with ICESat-2 data access methods, emphasizing programmatic access to NSIDC resources.
2. Become familiar with the `icepyx` library, which provides a wrapper to NSIDC's Application Programming Interface (API).
3. Create an icesat2data object (the primary class of `icepyx`) and use it to search, order, and download ICESat-2 data.
