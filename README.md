# Access and Customize ICESat-2 Data Tutorials


## Presenters and Authors

Jessica Scheick, University of Maine, lead `icepyx` developer

Amy Steiker, National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC DAAC)


## Summary

These tutorials will walk you though how to access ICESat-2 data, with an emphasis on programmatic access from the NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC DAAC) using the [`icepyx`](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx) Python library. Access parameters include spatial and temporal filters, as well as customization services including subsetting and reformatting.

## Key Learning Objectives

1. Understand ICESat-2 data access methods, using OpenAltimetry for data discovery and encouraging programmatic access to NSIDC resources.
2. Become familiar with the `icepyx` library, which provides a wrapper to NSIDC's Application Programming Interface (API).
3. Create an icesat2data object (the primary class of `icepyx`) and use it to search, order (with and without subsetting), and download ICESat-2 data.
